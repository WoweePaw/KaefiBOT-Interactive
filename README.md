# Kaefibot-Interactive
Use with https://woweepaw.itch.io/kaefibot *(formerly known as #StreamManager)*
Coded with :blue_heart: by [WoweePaw](https://twitch.tv/WoweePaw)

### How to Install/Use
- Head to `%appdata% > KaefGAMES > StreamManager > Interactive` and place the `.json` files in there.
- Start your KaefiBOT or (if already running) use Command `/actions reload` to reload the File for current Game/load for current Game
- Switch to a supported Game e.g. `Dead by Daylight` s.o.
- Profit!

### Nice but what is this about?
These are `.json` based files for KaefiBOT, a Chatbot for Twitch.tv which enables Interactive features like "press Shift for 5 Seconds" in a Game a file exists for.
The files also now support OSC-Parameters since KaefiBOT `InDev_2a862bf-16-01-2025` (not yet released to the Public as of 25.01.2025 but soon:tm:)

You can Download the latest Dev from [our Discord](https://discord.gg/woweepaw)!

**Some Files are a bit older then the rest. __No worries__, KaefiBOT WILL update them to the newest standard. I haven't had them used for a while, that's all...*

### Pull requests?
Sure thing. If you've created a fun file for a Game, not already existing, push it into the PR's :3
